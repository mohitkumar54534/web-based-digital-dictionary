    PHP(short for Hypertext PreProcessor) is the most widely used open source and general purpose server side scripting language used mainly in web development to create dynamic websites and applications. It was developed in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. A survey by W3Tech shows that almost 79% of the websites in their data are developed using PHP. It is not only used to build the web apps of many tech giants like Facebook but is also used to build many CMS (Content Management System) like WordPress, Drupal, Shopify, WooCommerce etc.
